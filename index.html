            My partner and I met in August of 2022. We decided to meet up in
            person after having messaged on the dating app<a
              href="https://hinge.co/"
            >
              Hinge
            </a>
            for a couple of weeks. Our conversations on Hinge had come so
            naturally, it was a pleasant change. We hit it off, bonding over our
            mutual nerdiness and devotion to the fandoms we loved.

            Christian grew up in a rural Missouri town after his family moved
            there from Houston, Texas. He’s got a big loving family that has
            welcomed me in warmly. He is a fantastic uncle to his many nieces
            and nephews. He and his brother-in-law run a business called Beskar
            Books, selling comic books. He enjoys playing music, and has a
            beautiful voice. He is also quite skilled at video games--in
            particular, a game called Destiny.

            Our relationship has been incredibly rewarding thus far. We grow and
            learn together, and it’s wonderful to feel safe and secure in doing
            so. Though we have many hobbies and activities we enjoy, probably
            our favorite thing to do is to stay in and watch movies, tv, and/or
            youtube. We are especially fond of the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CorridorCrew"> Corridor Crew </a>
            youtube channel, and look forward to watching the latest video on
            Saturday mornings. Outside of that we enjoy watching sports, and go
            to games when we can. Now that football season is over, we have
            transitioned into baseball. We try to travel when we can squeeze a
            quick trip in and have fun exploring new places together.

            Our relationship is still new, but we work hard on communication and
            showing up for each other. That has played a huge role in our
            happiness. I’m looking forward to what the future holds for us. We
            are planning to move into a place with my best friend, Cecile, in a
            couple of months. I am especially looking forward to paddle boarding
            and camping trips this summer. I am grateful on a daily basis for
            our relationship, and I am very happy that we met at this time in
            our lives.
